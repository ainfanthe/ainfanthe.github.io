  <h2>Caravaggio's Cephalophobic Obsession</h2>

	  <td colspan="3" align="justify">Caravaggio  I feel silly explaining as if you don't know Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio  was the most influential and imitated European painter in the first decades of the seventeenth century. Peter Robb's <u>M: The Man Who Became Caravaggio</u> starts with the premise that all the rumors about him were truepederast, drunkard, gambler, sword fighter, murderer, blasphemerand seeks to fill in the blanks. Not all historians agree with that particular storyline, but it makes for an entertaining read. These same historians acknowledge Caravaggio's genius and his death at an early age deprived the world of unknown masterpieces. While reading through my second or third book about him, I was suddenly struck by the number of his paintings that feature beheadings and decapitations. I'm by no means well versed in pre-twentieth century artin fact part of my initial interest in Caravaggio was to gain some critical knowledge of pre-modern art. Surely other painters of the time didn't paint so many beheadings, did they? Caravaggio's collected output is not so large; these eleven paintings seem to point to a perverse obsession. Note  the dates of paintings are not exact, and follow from Vittorio Sgarbi's 2007 book.</td>

    <tr><td><div align="right"><em>Sacrifice of Isaac</em> (1596?)  not a beheading scene exactly: Abraham is in the process of moving his knife to his sons neck when an angel stops him. Presumably, Abraham would have slit the neck in  ritual slaughter, but with Caravaggio calling the shots, Isaacs head would have ended up on the floor. The ram looks on in disbelief: "if Isaac is not to be sacrificed, then who... damn." A 1605 version of this theme has the figures in an entirely different pose, not quite as horrific, with a gleeful ram ready to jump upon the altar.</div></td>

    <tr><td><div align="right"><em>Burial of Saint Lucy</em> (1608)  A crowd gathers around as two workers dig Lucys grave. According to x-ray photography, originally Lucy was decapitated as she lay in front of the crowd. In the finished version, her head rejoins her body with just a slight neck wound. Did the commissioner of the painting, a church dedicated to Lucy, ask for the change? The myth is that she was stabbed in the neck and her eyes poked out, not as exciting as decapitation.  Note how Lucy's face looks like a wooden mask and so unlike the detailed expressions (even in the decapitated heads) of the other paintings here. Could this have been a rushed fix up by Caravaggio, Mario Minniti (former model and student of Caravaggio who was instrumental in generating the commission), or the church itself?</div></td>

    <td><em>Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist </em>(1609)  a slightly different version from the 1606 painting of the same name. This version looks like a more typical Caravaggio work. Salome still looks away from the head, which is not only on the platter, but being held aloft by the executioner. Salome is more concerned with collecting the juices  than carrying the head.</td>
